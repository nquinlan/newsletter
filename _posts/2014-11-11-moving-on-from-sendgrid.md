Hey!  
You may or may not remember signing up to receive emails from me, goodness knows, most people who signed up for this, signed up for it _a while_ ago. If you don't want to receive these emails, don't worry you can [stop them in their tracks, and **unsubscribe**]({{site.unsubscribe}}). If getting these emails is still interesting to you, then: Thanks! I'm glad you want to stick around.

![You're awesome!](/assets/2014-11-11/abed.gif)

As I promised when you signed up for this, there's a whole lot in this email, you'll find all sorts of stuff: [my travel schedule](#travel-schedule), my [reading/watching/listening list](#content-list), some [fun facts](#fun-facts), and various other bits and pieces. Finally, you'll find a [longer piece](#topic) at the end of the email. **Feel free to skim, skip sections, or only look at the GIFs**, I won't be offended.

However, please don't just view this as an email blast– view it as the start of a conversation. I have something I want to talk about and you seem pretty neat, **I want your opinion, ideas, and feedback**. So if anything in here strikes your interest **hit reply** and let's chat.

As you may know, [**last week was my final week at SendGrid**](http://endgrid.nicholasquinlan.com/). I'm moving on to be [The Commissioner of Major League Hacking](https://news.mlh.io/nick-quinlan-joins-major-league-hacking-commissioner-10-29-2014). Besides bringing me one step closer to achieving my lifelong dream of being Batman (I hear [Commissioners](/assets/2014-11-11/gordon.jpg) tend to work closely with him), it give me an opportunity to work with an [amazing team](http://mlh.io/about#team-sect) of people to [empower hackers everywhere](http://mlh.io/about#mission).

You can read some of what I achieved at SendGrid in [the site I made summarizing my time as an evangelist](http://endgrid.nicholasquinlan.com/). I also talk a little more about finishing my time at SendGrid at the [bottom of this email](#content).

**Go forth and explore…**

## <a name="travel-schedule"></a> Travel Schedule
_Please let me know if I'm going to intersect with you somewhere, I'd love to meet up for a beer or coffee._

- **New York City, NY** - Nov 16 - 26, 2014
- **Boulder, CO** - Nov 26 - Dec 3,2014
- **Austin, TX** - Dec 5 - 8, 2014

## <a name="content-list"></a> What I'm Watching, Reading, and Listening To
_I'm a voracious content consumer. Here's a sample of what I've dug over the last few months._

### Books

- [**How to Measure Anything** by Douglas W. Hubbard](http://www.amazon.com/How-Measure-Anything-Intangibles-Business/dp/0470539399) - While I'm not even finished with this book, it's already a favorite. It talks about discovering means to measure "Intangibles" particularly in business, but also elsewhere. _It's a very good read_, especially if you're interested in feedback or measurement.
- [**Fire in the Deep** by Vernor Vinge](http://www.amazon.com/Fire-Upon-Deep-Zones-Thought/dp/0812515285) - Any [Hugo Award](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hugo_Award_for_Best_Novel) winning [Space Opera](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Space_opera) is bound to be good. This one is _awesome_, it has wonderful world building, fantastic character development, and all sorts of adventure. Definitely worth a read if you like sci-fi.
- [**Shadow of the Giant** by Orson Scott Card](http://www.amazon.com/Shadow-Giant-The-Series/dp/0812571398) - The fourth book in the Shadow Series makes reading the entire series worthwhile, while every book in this series _rocks_– this one is 10/10 awesomes. I laughed, I cried, I suprised the person in the seat next to me.
- [**The Name of the Wind** by Patrick Rothfuss](http://www.amazon.com/The-Name-Wind-Kingkiller-Chronicle/dp/0756404746) - The begining of a three part fantasy saga following one man's story. After hearing it reccomended about 15 bajillion times, I decided I needed to read it. I opened it and _I could not put it down_.

### Podcasts

- [This American Life's **The Radio Drama Episode**](http://live.thisamericanlife.org/) (_video_) - This American Life is awesome, their live show at The Brooklyn Academy of Music is hilarious, touching, and full of spectacle. The funniest thing I've seen all year.
- [99 Percent Invisible's **Skyjacking**](http://99percentinvisible.org/episode/skyjacking/) - Maybe it's because I fly on planes so much, but I can't get this out of my head. A history of hijackings and what they did to the airline industry.
- [Planet Money's **The Signature**](http://www.npr.org/blogs/money/2014/08/29/344034815/episode-564-the-signature) - An exploration of what happens when you sign your name at the bottom of a credit card receipt. After listening to this episode, I think about this _literally_ every day, when I'm making a purchase.

### Music

- [**I Wanna Get Better** by The Bleachers](http://open.spotify.com/track/1RwwmiVtLAtPmxAqKVfwgG) Upbeat music with a chorus of "I wanna get better, better, better, better…" It's playing non-stop on my headphones. _My number one reason for dancing at bus stops this month._
- [**Blind Pilot**](http://open.spotify.com/artist/6qiGjRyN7TJ1GA2nXF68Hi) Soft, quiet music, pretty much the antithesis of my personality, but somehow it's been playing pretty constantly.

## <a name="fun-facts"></a> Fun Facts
- If you lined up every planet next to each other, they would fit in the space between the earth and the moon! [[pic](http://i.imgur.com/hexayzz.jpg)]
- The Sunfish can and does swim at both vertical _and_ horizontal orientations and has teeth in its throat rather than near its lips.
- The [Nightshade family](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Solanaceae) contains potatoes, tomatoes, tobacco, chili peppers, and bell pappers and accounted for over $132 billion of economic value in 2012. 

## <a name="content"></a> On Leaving
_I knew_ I was leaving SendGrid about a month before my last day. _I knew_ my team would need to pickup my responsibilities. _I knew_ I had to start showing them what I did. About a week later, _I knew_ I should have been doing that from the start.

> You want to be able to take somebody out of a business and have that business still have a value.
>
> – Art Feedman, [Making Money is Not Illegal, Immoral, or Fattening](http://www.amazon.com/Making-Money-Illegal-Immoral-Fattening/dp/1439225265)

To say SendGrid lost value when I left would be silly. However, the general sentiment of the quote still holds. Countless business leaders, teachers, and consultants always told me, _one of the chief failures of entrepreneurs is to create businesses that wouldn't survive them leaving (suddenly or otherwise)_. Advisors often ask of businesses, "What would happen, if &lt;stakeholder&gt; were hit by a bus?" Software engineers go a step further and create [a bus factor](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bus_factor): "the number of key developers who would need to be incapacitated to make a project unable to proceed." **Throughout my time at SendGrid, the bus factor of my projects very low.**

![I'm A Bus](/assets/2014-11-11/bus.gif)

That's not to say my team couldn't pickup my responsibilities, _of course they could_, they're some of the most talented people I've ever had the opportunity to work with. However, there'd certainly be knowledge lost and a good deal of time spent getting up to speed with what I was doing.

In my last four weeks at SendGrid, I started involving my coworkers more in my projects and my day-to-day. I started cc'ing them on emails that I hadn't before and exposing processes I had created for myself. By the end, there wasn't something I did that another co-worker didn't at least have a general grasp of. _I wish it had been that way from the beginning._

Some of my duties, I realized should have been shared tasks and if I had only shared knowledge about them sooner, I would have had help along the way. Others, like processes I created for myself, I realized were things that my coworkers could benefit from as I much as I did. With other tasks, my coworkers were able to see improvements that could be made or remove broken components. Finally, some processes improved simply because I made them easier for others to do.

My behavior didn't change much, but it brought a great deal of positive improvement for me and my team. Simply shifting my mindset, from _I'll always be able to do this_ to _someone else should be able to do it, too_ vastly improved the work I did.
