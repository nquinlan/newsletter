_Remember when you signed up for my newsletter? No? I've learned maintaining a newsletter is hard, I apologize for the fits-and-starts of this email._ For that reason, I'm trying a new formatâ€“ principally, a content round-up.

![Yeehaw](/assets/2015-06-27/round-up.gif)

My [reading/watching/listening list](#content-list) comes first, followed by [my travel schedule](#travel-schedule), finished off by some [fun facts](#fun-facts). **Feel free to skim, skip sections, or only look at the GIFs**, I won't be offended.

## <a name="content-list"></a> What I'm Watching, Reading, and Listening To
_I'm a voracious content consumer. Here's a sample of what I've dug over the last few months._

### TV & Movies
- [The Imitation Game](http://www.amazon.com/Imitation-Game-Benedict-Cumberbatch/dp/B00R7FZ074/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&qid=1435367553&sr=8-1&keywords=the+immitation+game&pebp=1435367556488&perid=0MS1SBR0DFH53QMA61JH) (Movie) - The story of Alan Turing, a parent of the computer is heart-wrenching at times and always interesting. Definitely worth your time, especially if you're in tech.
- [Big Hero 6](http://www.amazon.com/Big-Hero-Plus-Bonus-Features/dp/B00PC1X70W/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&qid=1435367715&sr=8-1&keywords=big+hero+six&pebp=1435367721495&perid=16DPBPM9FNR757XPN149) - I know I'm late to the party, but this was a truly great Disney Movie, with all the themes you would want.
- [The Good Wife](http://www.amazon.com/The-Good-Wife-Season-1/dp/B0064MGU98) (TV Show) - I hate to admit how quickly I binge watched the first five seasons, this legal drama brings excitement and intrigue to a screen near you. Just make sure you have no obligations before you start.

### Books
- [James H. Schmitz](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/James_H._Schmitz) was the first sci-fi author I ever experienced, as my dad read my little brother and me the [Witches of Karres](http://hell.pl/szymon/Baen/The%20Baltic%20War/The%20Witches%20of%20Karres/index.htm). I recently picked his stories up again. Widely lost to time due to his gravitation to short stories, he's truly a great author. You can read all his short stories [online for free](http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/author/24957) or [collected into volumes by Eric Flint and Baen](http://www.baen.com/author_catalog.asp?author=jhschmitz).
- [Dragonsbane](http://www.amazon.com/Dragonsbane-Winterlands-Book-Barbara-Hambly-ebook/dp/B004TC149G/ref=tmm_kin_swatch_0?_encoding=UTF8&sr=&qid=) by Barbara Hambly - I got onto Dragonsbane from the [Farseer Trilogy](http://www.amazon.com/Assassins-Apprentice-Farseer-Trilogy-Book/dp/055357339X) which I subsequently found from [The Kingkiller Chronicle](http://www.amazon.com/Name-Wind-Kingkiller-Chronicle-Day-ebook/dp/B0010SKUYM/ref=tmm_kin_swatch_0?_encoding=UTF8&sr=&qid=). All of which are good and follow similar themes, but Dragonsbane is undoubtedly the best of the three. _The second book in this email that you can thank my father for._
- [So You've Been Publicly Shamed](http://www.amazon.com/So-Youve-Been-Publicly-Shamed/dp/1594487138/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&qid=1435366564&sr=8-1&keywords=So+You%27ve+Been+Publicly+Shamed&pebp=1435366566388&perid=1FAPFKDWHC4XQXZW0ATF) by Jon  Ronson - A book about Public Shaming in the internet age. It's changed how I interact with "the mob." For a preview check out [Ronson's NY Times piece](http://www.nytimes.com/2015/02/15/magazine/how-one-stupid-tweet-ruined-justine-saccos-life.html) or [his appearance on Reply All](http://gimletmedia.com/episode/18-silence-and-respect/).
- [Turn the Ship Around](http://www.amazon.com/Turn-Ship-Around-Turning-Followers/dp/1591846404) by L. David Marquet - A book on leadership and removing followers from the equation of being on a team. It's definitely informed my management behavior. Hat Tip to [Paul Kincaid-Smith](https://twitter.com/cyclingup) for the recommendation by way of [Tim Falls](https://twitter.com/timfalls).

### Podcasts
- [Song Exploder, 38: tUnE-yArDs](http://songexploder.net/tune-yards) - Merrill Garbus discusses one of my favorite songs and how she made it. [Song Exploder](http://songexploder.net/) is an awesome podcast that I [recently saw live in Oakland](https://www.universe.com/events/roman-mars-song-exploder-live-with-matmos-tickets-oakland-5C6PS) with [99% Invisible](http://99percentinvisible.org/), I highly recommend listening to the entire archive.
- [Planet Money, 609: The Curse Of The Black Lotus](http://www.npr.org/sections/money/2015/03/11/392381112/episode-609-the-curse-of-the-black-lotus) - How Magic, The Gathering ensured the game remained sustainable. Also featured in the episode: a card shop, in which I've played [FNM](http://archive.wizards.com/Magic/tcg/events.aspx?x=events/magic/fnm).
- [Mystery Show](http://gimletmedia.com/show/mystery-show/) - Starlee Kine solves mysteries that can't be solved by the internet, and along the way learns personal details about everyone. A very different and very interesting show. Starlee Kine also does a great segment about [breakup songs for This American Life](http://www.thisamericanlife.org/radio-archives/episode/339/break-up?act=1).
- [The Truth, Remember the Baby](http://thetruthpodcast.com/Story/Entries/2015/6/4_Remember_the_Baby.html) - A story of a stroke from the fictional podcast [The Truth](http://thetruthpodcast.com/The_Truth.html) - worth listening to with headphones.
- [This American Life, 342: How to Rest in Peace, Act 2 - The Good Son.](http://www.thisamericanlife.org/radio-archives/episode/342/how-to-rest-in-peace?act=2) - A poignant story of a son who helps his mother practice her suicide. This segment always sticks with me for days, along with the story of [Still Alice](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Still_Alice_(novel)). 
- [99% Invisible, 140: Vexillonaire](http://99percentinvisible.org/episode/vexillonaire/) - With all the talks of flags recently, I've been sharing this episode of 99% Invisible a lot. If video is more your thing, checkout the [TED Talk](http://www.ted.com/talks/roman_mars_why_city_flags_may_be_the_worst_designed_thing_you_ve_never_noticed).

### Music
- [Life](https://open.spotify.com/track/61o9ek0A26KARnXBPssDv3) by Ludovico Einaudi - I've been listening to a ton of [Contemporary Classical](https://open.spotify.com/user/1177385688/playlist/1XbX5NYoSjKEFODoEeEMvV) and this song always sticks out. It's been my most listened song recently.
- [Stressed Out](https://open.spotify.com/track/3CRDbSIZ4r5MsZ0YwxuEkn) by Twenty One Pilots - Widely heralded as [the best act of Sasquatch](http://www.craveonline.com/music/articles/859427-sasquatch-2015-recap-photos-dues-paid-twenty-one-pilots-shine#/slide/1), I was intrigued and have listened to this song on non-stop over the past few days.
- Fingerlings (Albums) by Andrew Bird [
[1](https://open.spotify.com/album/6b5S9Q2MCOiCbYAl0MYcuh),
[2](https://open.spotify.com/album/6XAvhXN0hN5RscfIu7mOgf),
[3](https://open.spotify.com/album/30CP14kyXoPuFtvH8VGHdL),
[4](https://open.spotify.com/album/6g0XYCj2dR1RJxmGO0Iz72)
] - I've been digging the musical style of Andrew Bird's Fingerlings. Bird goes through a number of his songs and plays them more relaxed and less produced. An interesting change of pace, especially for an Andrew Bird fan.
- [The Cat Came Back](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Cat_Came_Back) by  Harry S. Miller - While there are [no good renditions online](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_cUXj3zb_UY), I have a number of great memories singing this around the campfire. I recently rediscovered it and have been exploring the regional variants and boundaries. West Coasters are always aghast that its taught to children.
