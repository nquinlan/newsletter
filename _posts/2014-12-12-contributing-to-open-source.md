This is by far my favorite article on starting with open source. It's by Steve Klabnik, about how he became a Rails Core Contributor. http://words.steveklabnik.com/how-to-be-an-open-source-gardener

Here are a bunch of Pull Requests I've made:
- Small Documentation Change https://github.com/apiaryio/ivy/pull/46
- Minor "Bug" Fix https://github.com/freerobby/sendgrid_toolkit/pull/23
- Feature Addition https://github.com/MLH/cal.mlh.io/pull/3

Here's all my successful third party Pull Requests https://github.com/pulls?q=is%3Apr+author%3Anquinlan+is%3Aclosed+-user%3Asendgrid+-repo%3Astevestreza%2FDevCenter.me+-user%3Anquinlan+

Anyway, I highly recommend you start contributing any way you can, whether it's issue triage, bug fixes, or new features. It's a great way to get involved with a project or just better understand a language or codebase.

My good buddy Scotty Motte will actually send you a t-shirt if you make a PR, so go ahead and do that for sure: http://www.mot.la/startup-shirts.html

You make library maintainers day when you make a PR. This is me dancing at the very thought of getting a PR (https://www.facebook.com/photo.php?fbid=10202326501778606&set=t.1073670219&type=3&theater). So don't be afraid. PRs make people happy.

That said, it's important to make good PRs and understand that sometimes even the best PRs may be rejected.

Don't let that discourage you at all, though. Libraries are big and strange and sometimes added features need to be considered heavily before they're addedâ€“ so sometimes your work can go by the wayside.

If your PR isn't accepted, you can always create a module that extends the library, or a plugin, or a fork. There's lots of way that your code is not lost. 

However, making a bug fix is the best way to ensure your PR is accepted. Bug fixes are almost always accepted, features are not. Bug fixes also tend to be much more helpful to maintainers as they have their own ideas for roadmap, and your feature might not be on it (or might be on it in a different way).

I said a little while ago, you should make good pull requests. Good PRs are easy: explain the changes you've made and why you've made them. Make good commits with good messages. Make sure you test your code.

So, what are you waiting for? Go do it!
